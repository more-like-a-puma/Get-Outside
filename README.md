Get Outside is a user generated database. It's purpose is to assist a user with information about destinations and activities that they can do there.

It uses:

* Ruby version = 2.3.1

* Postgresql version = 0.15

* Background images are all courtesy of https://unsplash.com


In the future I do plan to add in a weather api on the destination show pages as well as user reviews.
